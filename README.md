# Trajectory_Score_Library


A fancy Antescofo Library converting mathematical parametric functions into curves controlling Spat sources' trajectories. 
The outcome of these processes are X, Y and Z or Azimut, Elevation and Distance you can scale and convert to suitable data.

The MaxMsp files are just demo patchs. Use the data your own way. 

Thanks to Jean-Louis Giavitto & Thibaut Carpentier for their kind support.
